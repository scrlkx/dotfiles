# dotfiles

My personal set of dotfiles and settings stuff.

## What's inside

There are several cool things like:

- Git setup (with mixed settings support)
- Z Shell, Antigen and some nice plugins
- Custom aliases

And more!

## Before install

To make a full use of dotfiles you will need to install the following softwares: 
1. [git][]
2. [diff-so-fancy][] 
3. [Z Shell][]
4. [Oh My Zsh][]
